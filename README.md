Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
Software engineering is the te systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools in order to develop and maintain software systems. This is importand because all systems start at creation and will need development so that they can be used in various aspects of everyday life in order to improve tasks and make procidures more effective.

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
An initial milestone is the development of programming lauguages such as Fortran which was orginally used for numeric and scientific application eg Formulas, and was developed by IBM.
Another is the establishment of software enginnering as a discipline; this means it has become formalised and structures are now put in place in learning for it. Books are now published on methodlogies and theories with everyone now having access to it.
Lastly, the advent of structured programming; this is programming theory which looks at the ways to combine programs to make a computabale function.This theory was them applied to highlevel programming languages which now have structures.

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
1: Requirements, this is collecting and documenting user needs for the system and its requirements.
2: Design; the software architecture and interfac; how it will interact with users and look
3: Implementation; actually writing the code to build the software based on the designs. 
4: Testing; making sure the software works as planned and meets quality standards and requirements.
5: Deployment; release a version and get the customers to interact with the software.
6: Maintenance: provide support , update features overtime and improve the software.

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**

The waterfall method invloves a structured step process to developing a software each step has a place and you only move on to the next after one is completed. Agile on the other is a flexiable and interative process that uses feedback.
A waterfall process example would be in a large devleopment project such as a goverment centered software for electricity management this will most likely have multiple teams and is difficult to manage unless it has phases and clear outlined steps. 
The agile would be seen on smaller more consumer centered project such as an social media app . Where feedback on usability can be given and features can be developed along the way.

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**
The software developer's role is to write code and impliment software solutions the Quality assurance engineer makes sure software reaches set standards by desgining and excuting test plans. The Project manager supervises the project by overlooking the planning and excecution. 


**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**

The IDE is the software environment that provides the tools to write and test the code while the VCS tools help to track the changes made to source code and coordinate team work. 
The IDE is important because the right IDE means increased productivy and flexibility, each IDE has its own features and customisations that can help in writing code. VCS is imporatnat because as you develop you will want multiple versions of the software, you will also want to go back to previous code if you encounter changes with errors this brings ease and collaboration within a team, multiple people working and version tracking.

**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
chaning requirments during development; whcih creates stress and delays; this is overcome by effectivly communicating the requirements and limitations in the beginning of the project to the client. This reduces ambiguity and ensures the client understands what the endproduct is before the start.
Tight deadlines which creates rushed work and reduced quality; This can be overcome by using alie methodologies this is because it uses a Work in progess nature and features and improvements are interative, this means more flexibility even with a short deadline.

**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**

Unit testing: testing individual componenets of a software.
Integration testing: testing interactions between componenets.
System tesing: testing the whole system.
Acceptance testing: testing against user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
Prompt engineering is creating questions to get the best possible answers from AI models.
This is important as it helps avoid vague answers, wrong answers and it teaches the AI .



**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**

Vague: What does a software engineer do?
Improved: Could you explain what a software engineer does from the perspective of a very old man who does not interact with technology often.
